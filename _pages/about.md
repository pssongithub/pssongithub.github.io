I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science in [VCC](https://vcc.tech/index.html) at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/).

I am interested in Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Robotics, especially in neural structural reconstruction and generation from different data sources (e.g. images, point clouds, distance fields).
