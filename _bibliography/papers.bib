       Managing the level-of-detail (LOD) in architectural models is crucial yet challenging, particularly for effective representation and visualization of buildings. Traditional approaches often fail to deliver controllable detail alongside semantic consistency, especially when dealing with noisy and inconsistent inputs. We address these limitations with Co-LOD, a new approach specifically designed for effective LOD management in architectural modeling. Co-LOD employs shape co-analysis to standardize geometric structures across multiple buildings, facilitating the progressive and consistent generation of LODs. This method allows for precise detailing in both individual models and model collections, ensuring semantic integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Co-LOD effectively applies accurate LOD across a variety of architectural inputs, consistently delivering superior detail and quality in LOD representations.

    abstract={
       We introduce a novel method for acquiring boundary representations (B-Reps) of 3D CAD models which involves a two-step process: it first applies a spatial partitioning, referred to as the ``split``, followed by a ``fit`` operation to derive a single primitive within each partition. Specifically, our partitioning aims to produce the classical Voronoi diagram of the set of ground-truth (GT) B-Rep primitives. In contrast to prior B-Rep constructions which were bottom-up, either via direct primitive fitting or point clustering, our Split-and-Fit approach is top-down and structure-aware, since a Voronoi partition explicitly reveals both the number of and the connections between the primitives. We design a neural network to predict the Voronoi diagram from an input point cloud or distance field via a binary classification. We show that our network, coined NVD-Net for neural Voronoi diagrams, can effectively learn Voronoi partitions for CAD models from training data and exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that the resulting B-Reps, consisting of parametric surfaces, curves, and vertices, are more plausible than those obtained by existing alternatives, with significant improvements in reconstruction quality. Code will be released on https://github.com/yilinliu77/NVDNet.
